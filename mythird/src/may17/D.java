  //•	Short Hand If...Else (Ternary Operator)
//•	There is also a short-hand if else, which is known as the ternary operator because it consists of three operands. It can be used to replace multiple lines of code with a single line. It is often used to replace simple if else statements:
//•	Syntax
//•	variable = (condition) ? expressionTrue :  expressionFalse;
//•	Instead of writing:
//•	Example
//•	int time = 20;
//•	if (time < 18) {
//•	  System.out.println("Good day.");
//•	} else {
//•	  System.out.println("Good evening.");
//•	}
